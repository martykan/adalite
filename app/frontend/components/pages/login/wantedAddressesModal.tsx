        You are delegating to our pool NUFIB and we are very happy that you chose to stake with us.
        However, your substantial stake is saturating the pool to 120%. By doing so, you are missing
        out on around 15% of your staking rewards from your stake there.
      </p>
      <p className="wanted-text">
        Don't worry, for such cases, we have setup a dedicated staking infrastructure. To optimize
        your staking profits, we pre-filled more suitable pools specifically for your addresses, you
        just have to delegate the stake again from all affected accounts in the "Staking" tab.
